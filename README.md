# My Generative Art Project

This is my project in which I play around with procedural generation to create art of sorts. As of now, the project is written in Java 17. Each branch of the repository corresponds to a piece, identified by the seed used.

## How To

To reconstruct a given piece, checkout to the noted commit and use the provided seed. 

## Libraries

![SpongePowered's noise](https://github.com/SpongePowered/noise) - _Currently only used in the FBMNoise class for simplex noise._

## Pieces

Here is each of the pieces with the seed used and the last commit value.
